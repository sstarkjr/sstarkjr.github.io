### **Data Science | AI | Corporate Strategy**
My work spans analytics, data science, and corporate strategy. I specialize in **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **enterprise-grade generative ai** techniques. My work often involves leveraging **large language models (LLMs)** to solve complex business challenges and uncover actionable insights -- at the intersection of analytics and corporate strategy.

### **Photography**
I take photos as a creative hobby—usually with my DSLR or drone. I gravitate toward landscapes, city scenes, and anything with a strong visual story. I like the mix of tech and creativity—shooting, editing, figuring out how to get the shot just right, and testing out whatever gear helps me get there. It’s a fun way to explore and unwind.

This website is built using the **[Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)**, a flexible and feature-rich Jekyll theme originally based on the **Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme** by Michael Rose. It is hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**, which automatically generates the site from structured markdown files and code stored in a GitHub repository.
