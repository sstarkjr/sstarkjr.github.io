## **What I Do**
### **Data Science & AI**
I specialize in **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** techniques. My work often involves leveraging **large language models (LLMs)** to solve complex business challenges and uncover actionable insights.

### **Photography**
I take photos as a creative hobby, mostly using my DSLR and drone. I’m drawn to landscapes, city scenes, and anything with a strong visual story. I like the mix of tech and creativity — shooting, editing, and figuring out how to get the shot just right. It’s a fun way to explore and unwind.

## **About This Website**

This website is built using the **[Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)**, a flexible and feature-rich Jekyll theme originally based on the **Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme** by Michael Rose. It is hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**, which automatically generates the site from structured markdown files and code stored in a GitHub repository.
