## **About This Website**

This website is built using the **[Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)**, a flexible and feature-rich Jekyll theme originally based on the **Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme** by Michael Rose. It is hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**, which automatically generates the site from structured markdown files and code stored in a GitHub repository.
