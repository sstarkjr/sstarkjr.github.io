<h1>Recreate This Website</h1>
<p>If you'd like to recreate this website, you can follow the tutorial linked below:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/g6AJ9qPPoyc?feature=shared" target="_blank">Youtube Tutorial</a></p>

<p>Setting up this website was incredibly easy, thanks to the tutorial. I don't often see blogs/personal websites share instructions for how to recreate them so I wanted to pass this along. Give this tutorial a try. Click the link or search "How To Build A Website | Github Pages | Jekyll | Template" by Spencer Pao. I guarantee you'll be up and running in no time.</p>
