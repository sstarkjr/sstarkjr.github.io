## Customer Segmentation Analysis
This project demonstrates the use of clustering techniques like K-Means and DBSCAN to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Key components include:

- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the customer data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Using RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).
- **Clustering**: Applying K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms.
- **Insights**: Identifying distinct customer segments and actionable strategies.
