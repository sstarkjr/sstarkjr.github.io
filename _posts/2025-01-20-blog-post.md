# Introduction

Understanding customer feedback is a classic analytics challenge. The qualitative side is just as important as the quantitative ‚Äî but much harder to process at scale. Product reviews are rich with insight, serving a range of stakeholders: *consumers* looking to make decisions, *product designers* hunting for feedback, and *marketers* seeking to better understand how people talk about the product.

But at some point, the sheer volume becomes overwhelming. How do you programmatically analyze thousands of reviews?

To tackle this, I break down each review into a set of **key phrases** using a large language model. In my prompt, I define a key phrase as a short, standalone snippet that captures one salient idea, theme, or sentiment. This approach works well to extract the distinct concepts often embedded within a single review.

For this project, I used a publicly available dataset of Amazon reviews for the **Cuisinart SS-10P1 Single Serve Coffee Maker**. It‚Äôs a product I know well, and with thousands of reviews and many features, it‚Äôs ideal for surfacing rich customer feedback.

**Tools used**: Python, OpenAI API, UMAP, Plotly

# Step 1: Gather and Clean the Review Data

The dataset comes from the Amazon open review collection. I filtered it down to one product using the ASIN: `[INSERT_ASIN_HERE]`.

Modern LLMs are forgiving of messy text, so the cleaning process was light:
- Removed duplicate entries
- Dropped null values

# Step 2: Extract Key Phrases with an LLM

To extract key phrases, I used a batch LLM pipeline. Here‚Äôs the core of the prompt I passed:

> *‚ÄúAnalyze the following product review. Analyze each text string, identifying key phrases that capture the most salient themes and topics.‚Äù*  
> You will be provided with product review details, and you will output a JSON object:

```json
{
  "key_phrases": [ ... ],
  "summary": "..."
}
````

> **Review Details:**
>
> * Review Title: {review\_title}
> * Review Text: {review\_text}
> * Star Rating: {rating}

> **Note:**
>
> * Rely only on the product review provided.
> * Always answer honestly and truthfully.

### ‚ö° Batch Processing Matters

Processing 2,500 reviews one-by-one at \~7 seconds each would have taken over 4.5 hours. With batching, the same task finished in just \~30 minutes ‚Äî a **90% speedup**.

üß∫ I like to think of batching like using multiple washing machines. One load at a time is slow; many running in parallel finishes the job quickly.

After parsing the results, I exploded each list of key phrases into individual rows in a DataFrame.

# Step 3: Generate Embeddings for Key Phrases

With key phrases in hand, I generated text embeddings using OpenAI‚Äôs `text-embedding-3-small` model (500 dimensions). These embeddings capture the **semantic meaning** of each phrase as a vector in high-dimensional space.

‚û°Ô∏è *\[Insert embedding generation code snippet]*

# Step 4: Dimensionality Reduction with UMAP

To visualize the embeddings, I used **UMAP** (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce them from 500 dimensions to just 2.

UMAP is especially good at preserving both local and global structure ‚Äî making it ideal for semantic data like this.

```python
from umap import UMAP

umap_model = UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, metric='cosine', random_state=42)
umap_coords = umap_model.fit_transform(embedding_matrix)
```

‚û°Ô∏è *\[Optional: Insert 2D plot preview or UMAP configuration image]*

# Step 5: Visualize in 2D

Using Plotly, I created an interactive scatterplot where each dot is a key phrase. You can zoom, hover, and explore how semantically similar concepts naturally cluster together.

Some examples:

* "hot water dispenser" and "fast heating" are close together
* Cleaning-related phrases form their own group
* Mentions of "programmable timer" and "auto shut-off" sit near each other

‚û°Ô∏è *Try zooming in ‚Äî many clusters are quite interpretable.*

# Conclusion

This workflow transforms raw text into structured, visual insights through:

* ‚úÖ **Key phrase extraction using an LLM**
* ‚úÖ **Semantic embedding with OpenAI**
* ‚úÖ **Dimensionality reduction with UMAP**
* ‚úÖ **Interactive 2D visualization with Plotly**

This approach helps uncover patterns that would be nearly impossible to detect manually.

### üß≠ What's Next?

In a future post, I‚Äôll explore how to:

* Cluster the key phrases
* Automatically label topic groups
* Extract actionable insights across thousands of reviews
