I came across this spotify Engineering Blog Post "Building Confidence: A Case Study in How to Create Confidence Scores for GenAI Applications"

https://engineering.atspotify.com/2024/12/building-confidence-a-case-study-in-how-to-create-confidence-scores-for-genai-applications

I would like to apply some of these techniques to my own datasets. 

I plan to add to this post in the future.
